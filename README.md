# njsm

The NSM <-> JACK Session bridge.

## What?

njsm bridges Non Session Manager and JACK Session. This allows programs
that support JACK Session (say, jalv) to run inside nsm-proxy and have
their data saved using njsm.

## Why?

Because I use NSM, but some programs want JACK Session. njsm means we
get the best of both worlds.

## Status

Prototype. I've just about got something that almost works, kinda.
